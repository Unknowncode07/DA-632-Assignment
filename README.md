Topic : DFT transform, its computation and illustration of its properties using synthetic signals and real-world signals

# Summary

In this notebook, we explored the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and its computational properties. We learned how to compute the DFT and verified its properties using Python. Additionally, we discussed recent advancements in DFT computation, such as the Sparse Fast Fourier Transform (SFFT). Unlike traditional FFT methods, SFFT leverages sparsity in signals to achieve faster processing. However, we noted that while the DFT offers insights into the frequency components of a signal, it lacks information about when these frequencies occur. To address this limitation and gain a deeper understanding of both frequency and time aspects, we introduced other transforms like the Wavelet Transform. This approach allows us to analyze signals in both the frequency and time domains, providing richer insights into their characteristics.
